<h3>About</h3>

HTML-Render is an API whose main purpose is to convert HTML and CSS into an image, which can be used by the user.
I created this API because I wanted to put into practice my knowledge with the [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.1.x/) framework. Also, the API format makes it easy to implement with other technologies and languages, and the quality of the images is very good.

The entire project was created with [React](https://reactjs.org/) in addition to the use of certain repositories such as axios and cors-anywhere for certain vital aspects of the project.

-   Functioning
    -   You get information about the weather through a 32-bit reference identifier (Woeid) that is obtained through a request. It takes as data your current Latitude and Longitude and when you receive all this information it is stored in local storage so that you don't have to ask for the information every time you close or open the extension. It also has a function that detects when the day has changed and automatically updates the weather information.
-   Use of [Axios](https://github.com/axios/axios)
    -   Axios is a JavaScript library that can be executed in the browser and allows us to make HTTP client operations easy, so we can configure and make requests to a server and receive easy-to-process responses.
-   Use of [Cors-Anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere)
    -   CORS Anywhere is a NodeJS proxy which adds CORS headers to the proxied request.Thanks to it we were able to communicate with the API without any problem. By creating a personal proxy this [solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/43881141) comes from user sideshowbarker on StackOverflow.
-   What I learned
    -   During the development of this project I learned a lot about the use of APIs and web requests I also put into practice the use of asynchronous functions and other things that I had not used before in JavaScript.

## Features

Inside the extension we will be able to find:

<!-- - A button to get the information of a specific location. -->

The information displayed on the screen will be:

-   Temperature
-   Climate
-   Current date
-   Current location
-   Todayâ€™s Hightlights
    -   Wind status
    -   Humidity
    -   Visibility
    -   Air pressure

This application/site was created as a submission to a [devChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/mM1UIenRhK808W8qmLWv) was to build an application to complete the given user stories.
